pyatsyn
=======

pyatsyn is a python implementation of the Analysis-Transformation-Synthesis (ATS) spectral modeling system.

ATS is a spectral modeling system based on a sinusoidal plus critical-band noise decomposition. The 
system can be used to analyze recorded sounds, transform their spectrum using a wide variety of 
algorithms and resynthesize them both out of time and in real time.
